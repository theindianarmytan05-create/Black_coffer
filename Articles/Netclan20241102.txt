Client Background

Project Description
The objective was to develop a progress bar that can help costumes to estimate the analytics of the video. 
Our Solution
The client wanted a progress bar with the following filters:
Date filter: – Update the progress bar and count of the videos according to the date selected
Category filter: – Update the progress bar and the count of the videos according to the selected category
We have created a SQL query for getting a count of the videos from the full video table according to the filter selected in the app
In added video table some columns were missing to solve this we created a SQL query for joining the added video table to the other tables and return the count of the video according to the filter selected
